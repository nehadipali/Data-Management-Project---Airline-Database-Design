# Data-Management-Project---Airline-Database-Design
Designing a database for three major areas of airline operations - Customer Reservations, Operations and Wages Payable

United Airlines caters to 162 million passengers across 342 global destinations annually. With a fleet of 854 planes and an employee strength of over 96000, we estimate that there is a huge amount of data created, which can be used to optimize and improve different functions. The objective of our project was to design a database system solution which would cater to a client such as United, which would help them achieve their goal of providing customers with competitive fares, enhancing customer experience, optimizing operational efficiency and improving profitability.

We recommend a partially defensive but mostly offensive data strategy. This is done to protect sensitive information and comply with governmental regulations, while gaining competitive advantage and improving profitability.

Our database system solution caters to three prominent areas of the airline industry- 
- Customer Reservations
- Operations and Maintenance
- Wages Payable

The main challenge in this scenario from a data management perspective seems to be aggregating the data from a multitude of sources.
- In case of customer reservations, we have a number of ticket booking websites such as Kayak, Expedia, etc.
- For operation and maintenance of aircrafts, there are a lot of spare parts which are provided by a number of vendors. 
- As a sizeable chunk of the workforce comprises of contract staff, United has to have a system to aggregate the details of the wages owed to the contractors

We used the bottom-up approach while designing the database system for United. The most valuable part about this project was understanding the working of the airline industry, translating the business knowledge into a data strategy, and designing an efficient system while taking the security into consideration.
